        Pickles (Start One Day Before):
    </h3>
    <p2 id = "par">
        &emsp;Thinly slice a cucumber and cut in half if you want. I did <br>
        &emsp;Heat up water, rice wine vinegar, sugar, salt, and chili flakes. <br>
        &emsp;I also threw some coriander and sesame seed in there. <br>
        &emsp;Like half cup water and half cup vinegar. <br>
        &emsp;Like one tablespoon sugar and one tablespoon salt. <br>
        &emsp;Throw whatever else you want in there. I could see some fresh ginger, fresh garlic being good. <br>
        &emsp;Maybe some soy sauce or sesame oil too. <br>
        &emsp;I just wanted it to be acidic and a little spicy anything else would probably also be good. <br>
        &emsp;Pour over cucumbers in mason jar and refrigerate for the night. <br>
    </p2>

    <h4 id = "head">
        Spicy Mayo Sauce:
    </h4>
    <p3 id = "par">
        &emsp;Just mix one part sriracha with one part mayo and then whatever else. <br>
        &emsp;I put some rice vinegar, msg, onion powder, toasted sesame oil in there. Do whatever. <br>
    </p3>

    <h5 id = "head">
        Other sauce I have not tried but might be good: 
    </h5>
    <p4 id = "par">
        &emsp;Heat some water, fish sauce, sriracha, sugar and reduce. Add some fresh garlic as it cools and that's it. <br>
        &emsp;I have zero idea on measurements I will figure it out when I make it. <br>
    </p4>

        Bread: 
    </h6>
    <p5 id = "par">
        &emsp;I'm not making a baguette so just buy one and toast well. <br>
    </p5>

    <h id = "head">
        Assembly:
    </h>
    <p6 id = "par">
        &emsp;Grab toasted baguette. <br>
        &emsp;Put the sauce on both pieces. <br>
        &emsp;Put on pieces of pork. <br>
        &emsp;Throw on the pickles. <br>
        &emsp;Can add some other veggies on top. Some julienned radish or carrot. <br>
        &emsp;Some freshly sliced jalapeno or fresno. Maybe some cilantro or parsley. Doesn't matter do whatever you want. <br>
        &emsp;I'd reccomend rolling it in aluminim foil or something because it makes sure nothing falls out <br>
